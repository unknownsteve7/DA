# 🔍 Step 1: Ask the Right Questions

> "A well-defined question is already half the solution."

Before jumping into data, STOP and THINK — What problem are we solving? What does the company actually want?

## 🎯 Understanding the Business Problem

Companies don’t say “Give me a pivot table.”  
They say:
- “Why are we losing customers?”
- “How can we increase revenue?”
- “What products are underperforming?”

Your job as an analyst is to translate vague problems into specific, data-driven questions.

# 🔍 Step 1: Ask the Right Questions

> “A great analysis doesn’t start with a spreadsheet. It starts with a **question**.”

Asking the right questions is *crucial* in data analysis to ensure you're addressing the core issues, extracting meaningful insights, and driving **actionable results**.

Effective questions should be:

✅ Specific  
✅ Measurable  
✅ Action-oriented  
✅ Relevant  
✅ Time-bound  

> Aka… SMART questions 💡

They should also be **open-ended** to encourage exploration and avoid bias.

## 🧠 1. Understand the Problem and Objectives

Start by digging deep into the business context:

- **What problem are we trying to solve?**  
  > Ex: Are customers leaving the app early?

- **What are the goals?**  
  > Ex: Increase retention, improve satisfaction?

- **What are stakeholders asking for?**  
  > Ex: What does the marketing team need to know?

## 🗣 2. Frame the Questions Right

Let’s build a ladder from basic to deep insights:

### 🟢 Descriptive Questions
> "What happened?"
- What is the average order value?
- What are the most common complaints?

### 🟡 Diagnostic Questions
> "Why did it happen?"
- Why did sales drop last month?
- What factors contribute to churn?

### 🔵 Counterfactual Questions
> "What *would* have happened?"
- What if we didn’t launch that campaign?
- What if we delayed the feature rollout?

### 🧠 Exploratory ‘What if’ Scenarios
> "What could happen?"
- What if we cut delivery time by 10%?
- What happens if we raise ad budget?

---

### 🪓 Break Down Big Questions

Too broad? Chop it up!

> ❌ “Why is our business underperforming?”  
> ✅ “Which region underperformed?” → “Which product line?” → “Which customer segment?”

---

### ✅ Tips for Crafting Questions

| ❗ Do | 🚫 Don’t |
|------|----------|
| Use open-ended questions ("What", "How", "Why") | Ask yes/no questions too early |
| Keep it SMART | Ask vague or abstract questions |
| Frame neutrally | Use leading questions like "Don’t you think..." |

---

## 📊 3. Evaluate Your Questions

- **Is this question answerable with the available data?**
- **Will the answer lead to a better decision?**
- **Does this align with business goals?**
- **Can this drive action?**
- **Am I seeing it from multiple perspectives?**

> If your answer helps someone *do something differently* — you’re golden. ✨

## 🧰 4. Tools and Frameworks

Use these mental frameworks to level-up your thinking:

### ✅ The “5Ws + H”:
- **Who** is involved?
- **What** happened?
- **Where** did it occur?
- **When** did it occur?
- **Why** did it happen?
- **How** can we fix or replicate it?

### ✅ The SMART Framework:
> Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Time-bound

### ✅ "Thinking With Data" (Max Shron Framework):
1. **Motivation**
2. **Structure**
3. **Data**
4. **Argument**

## 🎯 Final Word:

A good analyst isn’t just data-savvy — they’re a **strategic question-asker**.

You’re not here to just answer questions.  
You’re here to **ask better ones**.
